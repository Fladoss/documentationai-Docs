## Version Control for Docs

Every edit creates a new version automatically. You view history, compare changes, and restore previous versions without losing work.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
````javascript
// View versions via API
const versions = await client.docs.getVersions('doc-id');
console.log(versions); // [{ id: 'v1', date: '2024-01-15', changes: 'Added intro' }]
````

````bash
# CLI command to restore
cuddly-records docs restore doc-id v1.2.0
````
</CodeGroup>

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Features" default-open="false">
  Branching allows experimental edits without affecting the main version.

  Merge conflicts resolve automatically for text-only changes.
